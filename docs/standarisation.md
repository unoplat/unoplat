# Standarisation   
### **User Problems**   
- No base template exists for capturing information regarding release,changelog,artifact security posture etc. This blocks access to right information at any given point in time. it also creates barriers in creating generic distributed DevSecOps across ecosystem.   
   
   
### Unoplat Core Solution   
- Develop Base template which works for core application as well as software templates.    
   
   
     
### TODO   
- [x] Finish Unoplat base template - https://github.com/unoplat/base-project-structure    
- [ ] Make changes as per application template (the above works well for unoplat application templates)   
### Status   
In Progress
