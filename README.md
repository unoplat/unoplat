# Status - Pre Alpha - IN Development Not consumable!

# The Problem
https://github.com/unoplat

# The Solution
Launch SAAS exponentially faster and better through  vetted and tested multi layered approach consisting of IAC(Infrastructure as a code), PAAS(platform as a service) and TBAD (Template based application Development) all integrated with cross-cutting concerns taken care of.
